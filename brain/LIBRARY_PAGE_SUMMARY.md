- **Progressive Enhancement**: Graceful degradation

## API Integration

### Library API Endpoints Used
- `GET /api/library/files/` - File listing with pagination and filters
- `POST /api/library/files/` - File upload
- `PATCH /api/library/files/{id}/` - File metadata updates
- `DELETE /api/library/files/{id}/` - File deletion
- `POST /api/library/files/{id}/reprocess/` - Trigger reprocessing
- `GET /api/library/categories/` - Category management
- `GET /api/library/sources/` - Source management
- `GET /api/library/document-types/` - Document type management

### Metadata API Endpoints
- Categories, sources, and document types are loaded for filtering and metadata assignment
- Full CRUD operations supported through existing DRF viewsets

## State Management

### URL State (nuqs)
- `view` - Table vs grid display mode
- `search` - Text search query
- `categories` - Selected category filters
- `sources` - Selected source filters
- `document_types` - Selected document type filters
- `processing_status` - Selected processing status filters
- `page` - Current pagination page
- `page_size` - Items per page
- `ordering` - Sort field and direction

### Component State
- File selection for bulk operations
- Modal visibility and current file
- Loading states for async operations
- Error states with user-friendly messages

## Performance Optimizations

### Frontend
- **Lazy Loading**: Page loaded on demand via dynamic imports
- **Memoization**: Callbacks and computed values properly memoized
- **Debounced Search**: Search input debounced to reduce API calls
- **Virtual Scrolling**: Ready for large file lists (can be added)
- **Code Splitting**: Components loaded only when needed

### Backend
- **Pagination**: Efficient database queries with limits
- **Filtering**: Database-level filtering reduces data transfer
- **Caching**: Ready for Redis caching (can be added)
- **Bulk Operations**: Efficient batch operations for multiple files

## Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization
- All views require login (`@login_required`)
- API endpoints use DRF permissions
- File access controlled by user permissions

### File Validation
- File type validation on upload
- File size limits enforced
- MIME type checking
- Safe file handling practices

### Data Sanitization
- All user inputs validated with Zod schemas
- XSS prevention in file metadata
- SQL injection prevention via ORM

## Testing Considerations

### Component Testing
- React components can be tested with React Testing Library
- File upload functionality can be mocked
- API interactions can be stubbed

### Integration Testing
- End-to-end file upload and management flows
- Search and filtering functionality
- Authentication and authorization

### Performance Testing
- Large file upload performance
- Table rendering with many files
- Search and filter responsiveness

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Vector Search**: Semantic search across document content
2. **Document Relationships**: Visual connections between related files
3. **Export Options**: Bulk download and metadata export
4. **Import Options**: Batch upload from external sources
5. **Advanced Analytics**: Usage patterns and insights
6. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live updates
7. **Version Control**: File versioning and history
8. **Collaboration**: Sharing and commenting features

### Technical Improvements
1. **Virtual Scrolling**: Handle thousands of files efficiently
2. **Offline Support**: Cache files for offline access
3. **Progressive Upload**: Resume interrupted uploads
4. **Image Thumbnails**: Preview images in table
5. **Full-text Search**: Enhanced search across content
6. **Batch Processing**: Background processing queue

## Deployment Notes

### Requirements
- Django 5.2+ with DRF
- PostgreSQL with full-text search
