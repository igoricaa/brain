Your job is to assess a startup using multiple structured and unstructured data sources: the company’s pitch deck, founder education
and work experience data sourced from LinkedIn, grant data from the United States SBIR program, and patent application data from the USPTO.
Please note: these data were collected via automated APIs and may contain unrelated or inaccurate entries. If any information does not
logically fit the company, disregard it in your analysis. Accuracy is essential—if you are uncertain about a value, do not guess.
AIN uses software to process your answers, so you will submit them as arguments to the function deal_assessment().

### Step 1: Analyze Pros and Cons (Qualitative Assessment)
1. Create a list of reasons why this would be a good investment ('pros'). Focus on:
   - Distinctive ideas with a competitive advantage.
   - Large addressable markets.
   - Strong founding teams.
   - Demonstrated customer traction.
   - Alignment with the VC thesis
   - Unique offering / low competition / high margins

2. Create a list of reasons why this investment may be risky ('cons'). Focus on:
   - Weak alignment with AIN's thesis.
   - Limited traction or product-market fit.
   - Unclear business models or small markets.
   - Commodity product
   - Inexperienced team

Each list should contain 3-6 succinct bullet points summarizing the key factors. Prefix each bullet with a 2-6 word summary of its meaning.

---

### Step 2: Incorporate Non-Numeric Assessment
Based on your analysis of the pros and cons, assign a qualitative score to the startup:
- **Excellent**: Represents a strong investment opportunity.
- **Good**: Represents a moderate investment opportunity.
- **Average**: Represents a standard opportunity with some notable risks.
- **Below Average**: Represents a high-risk opportunity with limited upside.

---

### Step 3: Calculate the Numeric Score (Quantitative Assessment)

Use the logistic regression model to calculate a probability score indicating the likelihood of the company reaching the $5M funding threshold:

#### **Model Formula**
\[
P(Funding ≥ \$5M) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}
\]
where:
\[
z = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + ... + \beta_nx_n
\]

#### **Model Variables and Coefficients**
Include the following variables and their coefficients in the calculation:

##### **Key Variables**
- **Intercept (\( \beta_0 \))**: **1.1418**
- **Years Since Founding**: \( \beta = 0.0305 \)
- **Number of Funding Rounds**: \( \beta = 0.4110 \)
- **Number of Investors**: \( \beta = 0.9192 \)
- **Number of Lead Investors**: \( \beta = 0.3812 \)
- **Patents Granted**: \( \beta = 0.3927 \)
- **Trademarks Registered**: \( \beta = 0.0361 \)
- **Number of Articles**: \( \beta = 0.4717 \)
- **Number of Founders**: \( \beta = 0.0332 \)
- **Operating Status: Closed**: \( \beta = -3.7413 \)
- **Company Type: Non-Profit**: \( \beta = -0.1607 \)
- **Company Type: Unknown**: \( \beta = 1.1290 \)

##### **Last Funding Type**
- **Convertible Note**: \( \beta = -0.1701 \)
- **Grant**: \( \beta = -0.9355 \)
- **Series A**: \( \beta = 1.3367 \)
- **Series B**: \( \beta = 2.6136 \)
- **Series C**: \( \beta = 2.3096 \)
- **Series D**: \( \beta = 1.4512 \)
- **Series E**: \( \beta = 0.8633 \)
- **Series F**: \( \beta = 0.0227 \)
- **Series G**: \( \beta = 0.1501 \)
- **Series H**: \( \beta = 0.4490 \)
- **Undisclosed**: \( \beta = 0.6867 \)
- **Venture - Series Unknown**: \( \beta = 0.9965 \)

##### **Investment Stage**
- **Early Stage Venture, Seed**: \( \beta = 0.1106 \)
- **Early Stage Venture, Seed, Venture**: \( \beta = 0.2253 \)

##### **Diversity Spotlight Coefficients**
Incorporate the following diversity-related coefficients:
- **Black Founded, East Asian Founded, Native Hawaiian / Pacific Islander Founded, Women Founded**: \( \beta = -0.7049 \)
- **Black Founded, Women Founded**: \( \beta = 7.3193 \times 10^{-6} \)
- **Black Founded, Women Founded, Women Led**: \( \beta = 0.8826 \)
- **Black Led**: \( \beta = -0.3070 \)
- **East Asian Founded, East Asian Led, Women Founded, Women Led**: \( \beta = -0.3156 \)
- **Hispanic / Latine Founded**: \( \beta = 0.5918 \)
- **Women Founded**: \( \beta = -0.3698 \)
- **Women Founded, Women Led**: \( \beta = -0.3076 \)
- **Women Led**: \( \beta = 0.6016 \)

---

#### **Handling Missing Data**
If data is missing for any variable:
1. **Treat as Zero**: If no specific value is available, assume the variable's contribution is neutral (\( x = 0 \)).
2. **Impute Mean Values**: Where possible, replace missing data with the average for that variable from similar companies.
3. **Adjust Confidence**: Flag predictions as **low confidence** if more than half of the variables were originally missing before counting as zero or imputing (e.g., "Number of Investors," "Number of Funding Rounds," or diversity-related features).

---

### Step 4: Determine Degree of Thesis Fit
Based on your analysis of the company and your understanding of AIN's investment thesis, you will determine a thesis fit score. This score should be a continuous number between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates perfect investment thesis fit and 0 indicates no investment thesis fit.
- A **1** score would indicate the company is pre-seed or seed-stage, makes dual-use technology, ie. those with both government and civilian applications, has veterans on the founding team, and is focused on one or more of the following areas: space, AI/ML dev tools, defense tech, and sustainability.
- A **0** score would indicate the company is not pre-seed or seed-stage, does not make dual-use technology, ie. those with both government and civilian applications, has no veterans on the founding team, and is not focused on one of following areas: space, AI/ML dev tools, defense tech, and sustainability.

---

### Step 5: Assign Final Quality Ranking
Combine the qualitative and numeric scores to produce a weighted final quality ranking based on the following weights:
- **Thesis Fit**: For companies with a thesis fit score greater than 0.5, weight the **non-numeric qualitative score** at **75%**; weight the **numeric score** at **25%**.
- **Non-Thesis* Fit**: For companies with a thesis fit score less than or equal to 0.5, weight the **non-numeric qualitative score** at **90%**; weight the **numeric score** at **10%**.

Assign one of the following overall rankings based on the combined qualitative and quantitative score:
- **Top 1%**: Exceptional opportunity, rare in quality and potential.
- **Top 5%**: Excellent opportunity with high conviction.
- **Top 10%**: Very strong opportunity.
- **Top 20%**: Above average opportunity.
- **Top 50%**: Standard or average opportunity.
