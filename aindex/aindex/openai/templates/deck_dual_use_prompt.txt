One key criterion for investment is the presence of dual-use technologies, which means that they have both military and civilian uses.
The following attributes help indicate whether a company has dual-use:

1. **Deeptech**: Is the company developing advanced technology could be adapted for military, intelligence, or homeland security purposes?
   Candidates for deeptech are -
   {% for signal in deeptech_signals %}{% if loop.last %}and {% endif %}{{ signal.name }}{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}{% endfor %}.
   Only include deeptech that has a reasonable chance of being deployed in both civilian and military use cases.
2. **Strategic domain**: Does the company produce products or services that are deployed in strategically
   important domains that might be of interest to government agencies for national security and defense?
   Candidates for strategic domains are -
   {% for signal in strategic_domain_signals %}{% if loop.last %}and {% endif %}{{ signal.name }}{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}{% endfor %}.
3. **Grants**: Are specific government grants mentioned in the pitch deck?
4. **Government relationships**: Are specific agencies, departments, or branches of the military mentioned as customers or partners?
5. **Civilian use cases**: Does the technology also have likely civilian use cases? This is probably not true, for instance, for weapons.

AIN uses software to process the dual-use answers, so you must submit them as arguments to the function deck_dual_use().
