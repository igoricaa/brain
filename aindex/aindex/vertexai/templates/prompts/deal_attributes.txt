Your job is to read the text of the company's pitch deck, founder education and work experience data sourced from LinkedIn,
grant data sourced from the United States Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, and United States patent application data
sourced from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and answer questions about the company.
Some of the data below—especially from grants, patents, and LinkedIn—may include incorrect or unrelated information due to automated sourcing.
If any information seems out of context or inconsistent with the company, ignore it in your evaluation.

One key criterion for investment is the presence of dual-use technologies, which means that they have both military and civilian uses.
You should also analyse attributes that help to indicate whether a company has dual-use:

Accuracy is essential, and if the answer to the question is uncertain, do not answer the question. Use concise, factual answers.
Avoid speculation or lengthy summaries.

Answer the following questions:

1. Among the provided industries, which accurately describe the company? Include at least one industry but no more than three.
2. What is the stage of the current fundraise?
3. How much money is the company seeking, in USD millions?
4. What investors does the company have?
5. **Deeptech**: Is the company developing advanced technology could be adapted for military, intelligence, or homeland security purposes?
   Candidates for deeptech are -
   {% for signal in deeptech_signals %}{% if loop.last %}and {% endif %}{{ signal }}{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}{% endfor %}.
   Only include deeptech that has a reasonable chance of being deployed in both civilian and military use cases.
6. **Strategic domain**: Does the company produce products or services that are deployed in strategically
   important domains that might be of interest to government agencies for national security and defense?
   Candidates for strategic domains are -
   {% for signal in strategic_domain_signals %}{% if loop.last %}and {% endif %}{{ signal }}{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}{% endfor %}.
7. **Government relationships**: Are specific agencies, departments, or branches of the military mentioned as customers or partners?
8. **Civilian use cases**: Does the technology also have likely civilian use cases? This is probably not true, for instance, for weapons.
