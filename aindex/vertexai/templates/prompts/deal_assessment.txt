**DEAL EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS**
--------------------------------

### Step 1: Basic Deal Assessment

1. What problem is the company solving for its customers?
2. What product does the company offer, and how does it solve this problem?
3. What customer traction has the company received, if any?
   What is the company's business model?
5. What, if any, intellectual property protection has the company secured?
6. What is the company's estimate of its TAM or total market size?
7. How does the company position itself versus competitors?
   What does the company view as its competitive advantage? What competitors, if any, are named?

### Step 2: Determine Degree of Thesis Fit
Based on your analysis of the company and your understanding of AIN's investment thesis, you will provide an evaluation of thesis fit and determine a thesis fit score.

First, please evaluate: How well does this company align with AIN's core focus/thesis?

AIN looks for startups of the following kind: pre-seed and seed-stage, dual-use technology, ie. those with both government and civilian applications, veteran-led startups, biotech and life sciences, and startups in the specific areas of space, AI/ML dev tools, defense tech, and sustainability.

Second, please provide a thesis fit score. This score should be a continuous number between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates perfect investment thesis fit and 0 indicates no investment thesis fit.
- A **1** score would indicate the company is pre-seed or seed-stage, makes dual-use technology, ie. those with both government and civilian applications, has veterans on the founding team, and is focused on one or more of the following areas: space, AI/ML dev tools, defense tech, and sustainability.
- A **0** score would indicate the company is not pre-seed or seed-stage, does not make dual-use technology, ie. those with both government and civilian applications, has no veterans on the founding team, and is not focused on one of following areas: space, AI/ML dev tools, defense tech, life sciences, and sustainability.

### Step 3: Analyze Pros and Cons (Qualitative Assessment)
1. Create a list of reasons why this would be a good investment ('pros'). Focus on:
   - Distinctive ideas with a competitive advantage.
   - Large addressable markets.
   - Strong founding teams.
   - Demonstrated customer traction.
   - Alignment with the VC thesis
   - Unique offering / low competition / high margins

2. Create a list of reasons why this investment may be risky ('cons'). Focus on:
   - Weak alignment with AIN's thesis.
   - Limited traction or product-market fit.
   - Unclear business models or small markets.
   - Commodity product
   - Inexperienced team

Each list should contain 3-6 succinct bullet points summarizing the key factors. Prefix each bullet with a 2-6 word summary of its meaning.

---


### Step 4: Assign Final Quality Ranking

Assign one of the following overall rankings based on the combined qualitative and quantitative score:
- **Top 1%**: Exceptional opportunity, rare in quality and potential.
- **Top 5%**: Excellent opportunity with high conviction.
- **Top 10%**: Very strong opportunity.
- **Top 20%**: Above average opportunity.
- **Top 50%**: Standard or average opportunity.
